# Can IT work on my personal device? (Desktop, laptop, phone, etc.)

Unfortunately, Motlow State's Technical Operations department cannot work on a person's personal computer or laptop. However, we can assist with basic items that may involve your personal device, including:

  + WiFi connectivity
  + Basic assistance with installing Office 365 products
  + Configuring access to Motlow State email

Under no circumstance can we do much more than basic troubleshooting. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
