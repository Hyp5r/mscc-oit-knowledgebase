# How can I reset my TN eCampus account? : Motlow State Community College

To reset your TN eCampus D2L Brightspace account, you will need to either

1. Use the self-service password reset utility provided on the login screen (by clicking _Forgot your password_ or [by clicking here][1]), or
2. Contact the TN eCampus help desk at 866-895-8429

Technical Operations does not control your account on TN eCampus and unfortunately are unable to assist in resetting this account.
