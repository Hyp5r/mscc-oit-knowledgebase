# How do I take a screenshot of my computer?

## Windows

On Windows, you can take a screenshot using a keyboard shortcut in the following ways.

1. Press the `Print Screen (PrtScn)` button. This will take a screenshot of your entire screen and store it in your clipboard. You can then paste the screenshot in an application by right-clicking and selecting *Paste* or by pressing `Ctrl+V` on your keyboard.
2. Press `Alt+PrtScn`. This will take a screenshot of the active window on your screen and store it in your clipboard. Like above, you can paste it into any application as needed.
3. Press `Win+Shift+S`. This will open the snip and sketch tool and allow you to drag a shape to take a screenshot. Like the above options, the screenshot will be stored in your clipboard and can be pasted into other applications as needed.
4. Press `Win+PrtScn`. This will take a screenshot of your entire screen and save the screenshot in your Pictures folder. Look for a subfolder called _Screenshots_ to see screenshots taken in this manner.

## Mac

On Mac, you can take a screenshot using a keyboard shortcut in the following ways.

1. Press `Shift+Command+3`. This will take a screenshot of your entire screen and open the screenshot in Preview. From there, you can edit and save the screenshot as needed.
2. Press `Shift+Command+4`. This will allow you to capture a portion of your screen and open the portion in Preview. From there, you can edit and save the screenshot as needed.
3. Press `Control+Shift+Command+3`. This will take a screenshot of your entire screen and save it to your clipboard. You can then paste the screenshot in an application by right-clicking or two-finger-clicking and select **Paste** or by pressing `Command+V` on your keyboard.
4. Press `Control+Shift+Command+4`. This will allow you to capture a portion of your screen and save it to your clipboard. Like Option 3, the screenshot will be stored in your clipboard and can be pasted into other applications as needed.
