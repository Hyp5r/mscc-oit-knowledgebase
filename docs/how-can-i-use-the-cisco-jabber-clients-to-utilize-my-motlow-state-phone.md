# How can I use the Cisco Jabber clients to utilize my Motlow State phone?

To utilize the Cisco Jabber clients to access your Motlow State phone in new ways, please follow the following instructions.

1. [Submit a ticket](https://support.mscc.edu) with Technical Operations to request a Jabber setup. The ticket needs to include where you plan on using the Cisco Jabber client (Windows PC, Mac, Android, iOS).
    - Technical Operations will then create Jabber profiles for your phone on the backend. This has to be done first, otherwise you will be unable to sign into the Cisco Jabber clients.
2. Install the Cisco Jabber client on your device(s).
    - Windows & Mac: https://www.webex.com/downloads/jabber.html 
        - Click on the blue *Download for* button. 
    - Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cisco.im
    - iOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cisco-jabber/id467192391

In this next screen, you'll want to type in your Motlow State username (without the @mscc.edu on the end) and your Motlow State password. This is the same username and password that you use to login to other Motlow State services, such as the Motlow HUB and your computer.

!!! note

    For Mac users, you may see a window appear that requests permission to enable screen sharing and capture. This is safe to ignore.
