## New Office Message Encryption

If the message you received contains the blue bar with a white Office 365 logo, you've received an encrypted message using the New Office Message Encryption. To open this message, click on the blue **Read the message** button in the middle of the message. You should be taken to a screen that looks similar to the one below.

You'll have two options to open the message - **Sign in with a work or school account** or **Sign in with a one-time passcode**. Technical Operations recommends selecting the **Sign in with a one-time passcode** option. Once you click on that link, Office 365 will send you an email with a one-time code that you'll need to supply. Once that's done, you'll be able to view and reply to the message.

## Old Office Message Encryption

If the message you received contains the message *Save and open the attachment (message.html), and follow the instructions.* at the middle of the page with a gray padlock and the phrase *Message encryption by Microsoft Office 365* at the bottom, you've received an encrypted message using the Old Office Message Encryption. To open this message, you'll want to save the **message.html** attachment from the email, then open the attachment. You should see a window similar to the one below.
